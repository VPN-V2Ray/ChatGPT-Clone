# ChatGPT Clone
### üöÄ [Live Demo](https://chatgpt-clone-aakash.vercel.app/) - Edit (30/3/2023) : Although the website is up and running, my app has exhausted the OpenAI API free trial credits and thus will return error.
ChatGPT Clone is my attempt at developing an ML-AI chatbot based on [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) model which interacts in a conversational way.

## Methods

- I have made use of the [`text-davinci-003`](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3) model, which is the most capable GPT-3 model. It can do any task the other models can do, often with higher quality, longer output and better instruction-following. Also supports [inserting](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/completion/inserting-text) completions within text.
- Tested and deployed the chat-bot with a lower sampling-temperature value so that it takes lesser risks and gives
well-defined answers.
